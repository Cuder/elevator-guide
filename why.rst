DenvEL-4500 ensures passengers’ safety in case of fire, earthquake, power outage or other emergencies:

* the elevator conforms to the latest international safety requirements (`ISO 22559-1:2014`_); 
* multiple proximity sensors prevent the doors from unexpected closing or opening;
* when fire or seismic sensors are activated, the car stops at the nearest floor and opens the doors so that passengers can safely evacuate;
* if there is power outage, DenvEL-4500 uses emergency power supply to take passengers to the destination floor;
* if the car is overloaded, passengers hear an audio notification, and the car does not move until the load is below the rated capacity.

DenvEL-4500 Is Eco-friendly
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DenvEL-4500 uses cutting-edge technologies to reduce power consumption and CO\ :sub:`2` emission:

* LED indicators and downlights consume less power than conventional lamps;
* if there are several cars installed, the intellectual system selects the nearest one to minimize passengers’ waiting time and reduce power consumption;
* if there are no passengers in the car, the intellectual system automatically shuts down ventilation fans and turns off lights;
* the electric engine with enhanced traction mechanism reduces CO\ :sub:`2` emission;
* when the car moves down, the electric engine goes off, and the traction mechanism is used to regenerate power.
