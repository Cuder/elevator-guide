DenvEL-4500 ensures passengers’ safety in case of fire, earthquake, power outage or other emergencies:

* The elevator conforms to the latest international safety requirements (`ISO 22559-1:2014`_).
* Multiple proximity sensors prevent the doors from unexpected closing or opening.
* When fire or seismic sensors are activated, the car stops at the nearest floor and opens the doors so that passengers can safely evacuate.
* If there is power outage, DenvEL-4500 uses emergency power supply to take passengers to the destination floor.
* If the car is overloaded, passengers hear an audio notification, and the car does not move until the load is below the rated capacity.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DenvEL-4500 uses cutting-edge technologies to reduce power consumption and CO\ :sub:`2` emission:

* LED indicators and downlights consume less power than conventional lamps.
* If there are several cars installed, the intelligent system selects the nearest one to minimize passengers’ waiting time and reduce power consumption.
* If there are no passengers in the car, the intellectual system automatically shuts down ventilation fans and turns off lights.
* The electric engine with enhanced traction mechanism reduces CO\ :sub:`2` emission.
* When the car moves down, the electric engine goes off, and the traction mechanism is used to regenerate power.
