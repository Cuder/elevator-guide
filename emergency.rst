Dealing with Emergency Situations
---------------------------------

If the car is stuck between floors, if the door does not open, or in case of any other emergency situation, do the following:

#. Relax and do not panic. There is plenty of air in the car.

   .. warning:: Do not try to get out by yourself. IT IS DANGEROUS.
   
#. On the control panel (see :doc:`control-panel`), press the emergency call button.

   The |alarm| indicator will light up.
   
#. Wait until someone from emergency personnel answers.
#. Press and hold the push-to-talk button. State your problem clearly and then release the button.
#. Wait for the emergency personnel to fix the problem.
#. While help is on the way, keep calm and have an amiable conversation with other passengers.
